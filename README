Source file for the module: p4fs.c
Run make to compile the module
	- The moudle is compiled agains the 4.0.9 kernel provided with the VM (VMWare Player + KVM) @ /home/user/Desktop/VM/linux-4.0.9/
	

Available test files:
	test.c (compile using gcc -o test test.c)
	test_long_running.c (to easily test killing the process by writing to its signal file)

Notes:
====

1. Become root (by running 'su' on target machine) to easily navigate/dump file contents/write signal.
2. remount.sh is added to easily remout the file system.
3. Testing:
	a. Copy the module, test executables and remount.sh to the target (I simply scp the files into the KVM)
	b. Run su to become root
	c. Create directory "/mnt/p4fsdisk"
	d. Go to directory where all the files are copied
	e. Run command "./test 3; ./remount.sh"
		test exe will create a number of processes (15 for input 3) in a hierarchy
		As a result of remounting, the files will be visible in the FS @ /mnt/p4fsdisk
	f. To test signal delivery,
		Run "./test_long_running &" 
			PID will be printed on console
			Run the command
				find /mnt/p4fsdisk/ -name "<PID>.status"
			Use the directory info from the result of find command to write signal to the process' signal file.
4. Some screenshots are availabe in the archive to demonstrate.
